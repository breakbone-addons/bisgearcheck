## v2.1.0

### New Features
- **Faction Support**: Detects player faction and filters BiS lists to show only faction-appropriate items. Items in SourceDB can be tagged with a `faction` field ("Alliance" or "Horde"); untagged items are available to both.
- **Multi-Character Management**: Characters on the same WoW account can view and edit each other's wishlists. A character selector dropdown at the top of the addon window lets you switch between characters.
- **Gear Snapshots**: Each character's equipped gear is saved when they log in or change equipment, allowing other characters to see their gear on the Compare tab.
- **Per-Character Settings**: Spec selection, data source, and wishlist auto-filter are now saved per-character instead of account-wide.

### Changes
- SavedVariables restructured: `BiSGearCheckSaved` is account-wide (character registry, wishlists, tooltip settings), `BiSGearCheckChar` is per-character (spec, data source, filters).
- Automatic migration from pre-2.1.0 saved data format.
- Added `.pkgmeta` and GitHub Actions workflow for CurseForge packaging.

## v2.0.0

- Initial release with Compare, Wishlists, and BiS Lists tabs.
